# Handy-Editor-Scripts
Features / how it works:

Ideally you place your scripts inside a script folder.
Editor scripts must reside in an Editor Folder, therefor
this tool will automatically create an Editor folder where
your scripts reside.

When you select a script simply right click and choose:
Create > Handy Editor Script

The script automatically detects c#, Javascript and Boo.
When no editor folder exists an editor folder will be created
and the newly created editor script will written
to that location.

Existing Editor Folders or scripts won’t be overwritten.
